# Lexer-thing

A little toy language that I'm currently working on, written in Rust. So far it can only interpret basic expressions and statements. It's called "lexer-thing" because it was originally supposed to be a lexer. But then I wanted to turn the project into a language.
```

let x = (100) / 2;
let y = !false;

print "Hello"!;
```

## Currently working on
- Adding "environments" to support state.

## Features
- Basic unary expressions
- Boolean, string, and integer literals
- print statements
